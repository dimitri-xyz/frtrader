-- FIX FIX ME! Write/modify tests to ensure this now works before removing the comment.
{-
FIX ME!
There's a synchronization bug on this strategy "as is". When an order fill is detected. The open order state is immediately updated,
but we may still have to re-fill the account balances. If, in this interval, another orderbook event is issued, the
strategy will ask for the amount sold to be put on sale *again* even though we have not yet re-filled it.
To avoid this, we need to somehow keep track of the balances that are pending refills (and take these into consideration 
before asking for more placements).
